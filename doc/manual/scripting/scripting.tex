\section{Global Script}
    Some automatic variables are \symb{duration} and \symb{natural_time}.

  \subsection{Variables} \label{script:variables}
    If you want to use a variable in the waveform element lines, you should
    probably define that variable in the global variables/functions script.  By
    doing so, these variables will be available everywhere and also at any time.
    You can then modify these variables by specifying them as loop variables in
    the loop editor and selecting ``Global''.

    Any valid python expression that can be assigned can be used as a loop
    variable.  For instance, consider the following variables initialized in the
    global script:

    \begin{verbatim}
    Bfield = [0*Gauss, 10*Gauss, 123*Gauss]
    CoilCurrent = 4.2*A
    Frequency = dict( mot = -10*MHz, pgc = -40*MHz, image=0*MHz )
    \end{verbatim}

    These expressions and any valid Python expression involving these variables
    can be used anywhere in Arbwave.
