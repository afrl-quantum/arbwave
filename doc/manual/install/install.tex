\section{Prerequisites\index{Installing prerequisites}}

This project depends on several other python-related projects and these must
first be installed.

\subsection{Third-party Dependencies}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Python packages/libraries:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{python (2.X)} \\
      Python version 3.X will not currently work.
    \item \textbf{pygtk} \\
      Including of course the Gtk runtime.
      This package provides pygtk, gtk, and gobject imports.
    \item \textbf{matplotlib} \\
      This package also provides mpl\_toolkits import.
    \item \textbf{numpy} \\
      Generally, this is included as part of scipy and required for matplotlib.
    \item \textbf{scipy} \\
      scipy.interpolate imports are required for channel scaling/calibration.
    \item \textbf{python-graph} \\
      pygraph package is used for graph-analysis of connections between hardware
      components.
      On ubuntu, this package is named python-pygraph on ubuntu.
    \end{itemize}
  \item C libraries:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{NI DAQmx (nicaiu.dll)} \\
      Only needed if Viewpoint's DIO64 digital output/input board will be used.
    \item \textbf{Viewpoint DIO64 (dio64\_32.dll)} \\
      Only needed if NIDAQmx relevant hardware is going to be used.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Dependencies by S. Olson}
Most of the dependencies that are not satisfied by third-party vendors and/or
projects are a part of the arbwave project and, as such, are easily obtained by
downloading the entire project.  The project includes the following
dependencies:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{physical} \\
  dimensional analysis
  units and constants library (c++, python, octave, gnuplot).
\item \textbf{viewpoint} \\
  python wrapper library (wraps Viewpoint dio64\_32.dll c library)
  Only needed if Viewpoint's DIO64 digital output/input board will be used.
\item \textbf{pylibnidaqmx} \\
  This python wrapper library (wraps NI DAQmx nicaiu.dll c library) provides
  actual linkage to the NIDAQmx drivers.  Although this package is actually
  developed by a third party, modifications by S. Olson must be included.  It is
  therefore easiest to use the version that comes with the Arbwave project.
  Only needed if NIDAQmx relevant hardware is going to be used.
\end{itemize}
