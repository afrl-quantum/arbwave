% This BibTeX database can be used to make a consistent set of symbols for a
% document (very nice for very large documents).  
% This database is intended to be used with the modified gloss package
% (modified by S.E. Olson).
% Using the gloss package, it is also trivial to generate a "List of Symbols"
% index in a latex document.
%
% Consistent symbol labeling/formatting can be achieved by using either the
% \gloss command directly, or the \symb shortcut to  insert the symbol into
% text.  For example: 
%     The mean free path of a gas \symb{mfp} is given by
%     \[
%         \symb{mfp} = \frac{1}{ \sqrt{2} \symb{numberdensity} \symb{scatT} }
%     \]
%     where \symb{numberdensity} is the number density of the gas and
%     \symb{scatT} is the scattering cross section of the gas particles.

% the basic format is:
%(at)GLOSSDEF{symbol-key,
%        word = {symbol in latex-math mode},
%  definition = {Definition of symbol, only used for List of Symbols},
%   sort-word = {non-math-mode equivalent word used for sorting only},
%       group = {Sort group--see gloss documentation}
%}

% examples:
@SYMBOL{numberdensity,
        word = {n},
  definition = {Number density of a single species of gas},
   sort-word = {n},
       group = {S}
}

@SYMBOL{mfp,
        word = {\lambda_{\rm MFP}},
  definition = {Mean free path},
   sort-word = {lambda},
       group = {S}
}

@SYMBOL{scatT,
        word = {\sigma_{\rm T}},
  definition = {Total elastic scattering cross section},
   sort-word = {sigma},
       group = {S}
}

@SYMBOL{duration,
        word = {\var{dt}},
  definition = {Duration of waveform element or group of elements},
   sort-word = {dt},
       group = {S}
}

@SYMBOL{dt_clk,
        word = {\var{dt\_clk}},
  definition = {Minimum clock period of channel as defined by the source with
    which the channel is clocked},
   sort-word = {dt_clk},
       group = {S}
}

@SYMBOL{natural_time,
        word = {\var{t}},
  definition = {Natural start time of waveform element or group of elements},
   sort-word = {t},
       group = {S}
}

@SYMBOL{U0,
        word = {\var{U0}},
  definition = {The value of a channel at the beginning of a waveform element},
   sort-word = {U0},
       group = {S}
}

@SYMBOL{relative_time,
        word = {\var{x}},
  definition = {Relative waveform-element time used for value expressions when
                Sympy is found on the system.  Using this symbol automatically
                ensures that the expression is interpreted as a value
                expression.  The value of this variable can be considered to
                vary from [0..1] over the duration of the waveform element.},
   sort-word = {x},
       group = {S}
