experimental control program.

We can also refer to a figure as Fig.~\ref{fig:intro:jdk_grid_example}.

\begin{figure}[hb]
    \centerline{\includegraphics[angle=-90]{figures/jdk_grid_example}}
    \caption{Regular mesh on the left; stretched mesh, in both directions, on
             the right.}

\end{figure}

We just love to cite \citet{Rambo:1989}.
