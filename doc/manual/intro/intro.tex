This manual describes the use and operation of Arbwave, the arbitrary waveform
experimental control program.

\section{What is Arbwave?\index{What is Arbwave?}}
\subsection{Background}
Atomic physics experiments typically involve various voltages, currents,
magnetic fields, laser fields, and mechanical devices that must be manipulated
and altered according to very precise relative timing relationships.  It is
necessary to use hardware and software that provides for coordinating these
tight timing relationships.  The extent to which software and hardware are
able to present these timing relationships to a user in a succinct and
consistent fashion directly determines how well a configuration can be
tailored to the specific experimental situation.

\subsection{Open Source Software}
Arbwave is part of an effort from the Air Force Research Laboratory
(\acro{AFRL}) Cold-Atoms group to develop a platform suitable for typical atomic
physics experiments.  One of the goals of this effort is to provide a simple,
consistent view and control of experimental timing parameters.  This software is
released to the public in the form of an Open Source Software (\acro{OSS})
project.  This is done with the intent and hope that the community in general
can benefit from \acro{AFRL}'s work on Arbwave and to also foster collaboration
for and sharing of special experimental expertise permeating throughout the
scientific community.

\subsection{What can Arbwave do?}
Arbwave provides a means for a user to clearly coordinate groups of transitions
for various control signals that can be used to run a complicated experimental
timing sequence.  In Arbwave, a series of channels are defined where each
channel represents some control signal used to supervise an experimental
parameter such as voltage, current, magnetic field, etc.  Using the
information of the defined channels, Arbwave allows one to coordinate
hierarchical sets of transitions for each of those channels.  Arbwave also
graphically represents each of the signal transitions as complete waveforms
where the time for each transition is accurately shown.  Furthermore, Arbwave
facilitates execution of these waveforms in various operation patterns, such
as control-variable nested loop iteration and multi-variable optimization.
Finally, user scripting, via Python, can be inserted into the execution to
customize a particular experimental procedure, customize an optimization
procedure, and hook into various external data recorders' processors.


\section{Design Approach}

\begin{figure}[ht!]
  \centerline{\includegraphics[width=.4\textwidth]{figures/design-layout}}
  \caption[Arbwave design architecture]{
    Abstract view of Arbwave design architecture.  Arbwave is divided into
    abstracted layers to separate implementation details.
  }
  \label{fig:intro:design}
\end{figure}

As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:intro:design}, Arbwave is designed as a layered
operation platform.  Each layer represents a set of tasks or compartments of
computational requirements.  The interfaces between each layer are abstracted
such that only hardware-agnostic, generic interfaces are used.  The consistent
interfaces and abstraction concepts allow interaction between the layers without
strict need to understand the internals of the other layers.

Furthermore, this abstracted approach allows various layers and components of
Arbwave to be developed and extended without affecting the general operation of
the entire platform.  For example, since the hardware layer is abstracted away
from the computational engine and user interface of Arbwave, it was possible to
insert a near seamless communication layer that allows parts of the accessible
hardware to be provided by a remote connection.  Thus, as indicated in the lower
portion of Fig.~\ref{fig:intro:design}, several devices from various hosts can
be aggregated together for common control for a single experiment.
Additionally, because of this abstraction, it is possible to add support for new
hardware without disruption to the user interface and computational engine
layers: one must only implement the interfaces that Arbwave requires.


\subsection{Supported Hardware\index{Supported Hardware}}\label{sec:hardware}

Because the design of Arbwave abstracts the hardware support, adding new hardware does
not impact the normal functions of the platform.  It is possible, therefore, to
support a range of hardware and hardware drivers.  Tab.~\ref{tab:drivers} shows
the various hardware drivers and related devices for which the Arbwave backend
layer implements the required driver interfaces.

\subsubsection{National Instruments: \acro{DAQmx}}
Arbwave requires the knowledge of signal connections that are possible
with the various \acro{DAQmx} hardware.  As of yet, this information is only
known to be available via the NI-MAX Windows software from National
Instruments--no known documentation of these valid routes exists and no
programming interface to the \acro{DAQmx} c-library appears to give this
information.

Arbwave's use of \acro{DAQmx} generally provides support to most
analog and digital output hardware supported by \acro{DAQmx}.  In spite of this,
a small amount of information pertaining to direct signal routing
is needed to satisfy Arbwave coordinated timing requirements.
Tab.~\ref{tab:daqmx} shows a list of \acro{DAQmx} devices for which routing
information has been already included as of the date specified.

\end{table}

In order to use additional \acro{DAQmx} devices with Arbwave, it is
necessary to first add this routing information (gathered from NI-MAX) to the
Arbwave.backend.drivers.nidaqmx.routes sub-package found in the\\
\noindent \texttt{python/arbwave/backend/drivers/nidaqmx/routes.py} file.

Arbwave timing are indicated}
