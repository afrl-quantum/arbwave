Description: Arbitrary Waveform Experimental Control
 Arbwave is part of an effort from the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL)
 Cold-Atoms group to develop a platform suitable for typical atomic physics
 experiments.  One of the goals of this effort is to provide a simple,
 consistent view and control of experimental timing parameters.  This software
 is released to the public in the form of an Open Source Software (OSS) project.
 This is done with the intent and hope that the community in general can benefit
 from AFRL's work on Arbwave and to also foster collaboration for and sharing of
 special experimental expertise permeating throughout the scientific community.
 .
 This package includes the main Arbwave application.
