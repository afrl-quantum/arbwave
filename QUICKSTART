Quick Start:
In order to get at least a quick feel of what Arbwave is like, it can be very
helpful to run in Simulated Mode with one of the packaged examples.

To do this, use the '--simulated' command line.  There are two ways for you
to load up one of the examples.
  1.  Add the filename of one of the examples on the command line, such as:
    run.py --simulated examples/simple_config.py
    or perhaps:
    run.py --simulated examples/simple_ni_only_config.py
  2. Start Arbave up in simulated mode with 'run.py --simulated' and
  then use the Open menu option.  Browse to 'examples/' and select one of
  the included examples.
