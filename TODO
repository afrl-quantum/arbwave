1.  Verify that all the devices of a particular loaded configuration file are
    valid.
    It is probably critical that this verification and subsequent error handling
    is not done just after loading a file.  It may certainly be desirable to
    edit/view a configuration on a computer without devices.  This the proper
    time for verification is probably at the time that the run button is
    depressed.  Once verification has happened, perhaps we might just cache the
    result and only re-evaluate the validity of the current configuration if
    something has changed.
