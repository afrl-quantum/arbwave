Each device, output channel (analog, digital, timing), etc must be uniquely
identified by a path that also indicates is logical connections.  For example,
the National Instruments driver path begins with 'ni' and subsequent devices
served by this driver should be identified by 'sub-directories' within the 'ni'
path.  For example, analog channels in the 'ni' path are denoted like:
  ni/Dev1/ao0
  ni/Dev1/ao1
  ni/Dev2/ao0
  ni/Dev2/ao1
In this example, ni/Dev1/ao is a device that also includes at least channels 0
and 1.  In this example, it is also clear that each device driver must define
its own unique root path identifier, i.e. 'ni' for National Instruments, 'vp'
for Viewpoint, 'uei' for United Electronic Industries, and so forth.
Currently assigned prefixes:
  ni : National Instruments
  vp : Viewpoint


Common paths should use the same name regardless of which device they are on.
For example, the backplane trigger lines have been given these names (whether
they are being provided by a PXI chassis or a RTSI bus connection):
  TRIG/0
  TRIG/1
  TRIG/2
  TRIG/3
  TRIG/4
  TRIG/5
  TRIG/6

External, i.e. manual cable connections should be prefixed with 'External'.  For
example, if a cable goes from vp/Dev0/A/0 to ni/Dev1/PFI0, there will be two
routing configurations given in the program denoted by:
  vp/Dev0/A/0   ->  External/cable0
  ni/Dev1/PFI0  ->  External/cable0
where the connecting cable has been given the arbitrary, but necessarily
consistent, name of 'cable0'.
